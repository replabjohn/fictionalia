Let's move to Tynemouth, Tyne & Wear

This north-east coastal town is pretty near perfect

Tynemouth, Tyne & Wear: Craggy and handsome.



What's going for it? 
I like Tynemouth. Its got me written all over it. The town has a
wind-whipped feel (in a good way), and its bluff, craggy headland,
which sports a ruined ancient castle and priory, juts into the North
Sea, offering the town up to the elements. And the elements respond,
big time: Ive walked down Front Street with an air tunnel behind me
I could have taken off to the rooftops like Mary Poppins. This town
is fresh. Hardy souls crowd its three glorious beaches, while the
sturdier sort of surfer hits the waves deep into winter - this is one
of Britains finest surf spots - and if the local community gets its
way (and it usually does), the fabulous 20th-century outdoor pool on
the beach will be restored for the kind of person who likes nothing
better than 50 lengths in temperatures to turn your tootsies blue.
I stuck to a Victoria sponge in one of the tea shops. (Southern
softy.)


The case against 
Precious little: bar the odd spot of unsightly development and the
darker sides of Tyneside weather, its pretty near perfect.


Well connected? 
The Metro makes Monument station in downtown Newcastle in 22 minutes,
The A1 is 20 minutes, Sunderland 30 and Durham 40.


Schools 
Many primaries rated "good". St Marys RC, Rockcliffe First and
Waterville outstanding. Secondaries: Marden High is "good", John Spence
Community High "outstanding".


Hang out at

Longsands Fish Kitchen, the Surf Cafe, Dil & the Bear and Barca Art
Cafe. North Shields has a great fish quay.

more seaside beyond, with nice parades of Victorian town houses on

off; around Priors Park, and from Percy Park to King Edward Road.

From the streets

Ray Lowry 
"Great place, lots to do. The Priory is a thriving amateur theatre."

Steve Ratcliffe 
"Great sandy beaches, wonderful surfing; chocolatier (Gareth James)
and the best fish'n'chip shop on Tyneside - Marshalls - where Jimi Hendrix
dined after a gig."

Halen Lemberger 
"It's in a fog-prone area. Prepare yourself for the foghorn, day and
night!"
