Let's move to Leigh-on-Sea: What a difference 15 years makes

It was Let's move to's first visit, in 2001, and it was to be the Next
Big Thing  or so I thought

Leigh-on-Sea beach

Leigh-on-Sea: It has an artisan gelato house nowadays.


What's going for it? 
It's not quite time for my carriage clock. A cake with candles,
perhaps. For you, dear reader, have been watching me tapping away at
my computer on these pages since 2001. When I began Let's Move To
George Bush was in his first year as president, S Club 7 and Destiny's
Child were riding high in the charts. Leigh-on-Sea, our first visit,
was the Next Big Thing, or so I thought. What a difference 15 years
makes. Leigh was almost the Next Big Thing. It has an artisan gelato
house nowadays, and if someone had told us in 2001 that there would
be a Â£1.2m penthouse for sale on Broadway in 2016 I'd have choked on my
Starbucks (still exotic back then). Leigh has an authentic Ealing
Comedy feel, all stripy awnings and butchers that look like
Terry-Thomas. And, I noted in 2001, it might usefully serve as an
escape from the Smoke, because London house prices are criminal. Some
things never change.


The case against 
One can tire of the racks of 1920s semis. The old town is sweet as a
cockle, but marred by the train line.


Well connected? 
Trains: six to nine trains an hour; 48 mins to London Fenchurch
Street via Barking and West Ham, and 10 the other way to Southend.
Driving: 10 mins to Southend, just over half an hour to the M25 or to
Chelmsford, an hour to Stansted Airport. The roads in and out can
clog.


Schools 
Primaries: Chalkwell Hall, Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic,
Darlinghurst, Blenheim, Eastwood, Edwards Hall and Fairways are all
"good", says Ofsted, with Leigh North Street and West Leigh Junior
"outstanding". Secondaries: Belfairs Academy and St Thomas More High
are all "good".


Hang out at 
Cockle Row, munching on bivalves, looking across mud flats, followed
by strawberry and black pepper ice-cream at Poco Gelato.


Where to buy 
The river-front High Street with its cottages, cobbles and boatsheds
is just the right side of twee. Up the cliff, the new town is mostly
a late Victorian to 1950s affair. Between here and London Road,
millions of terraces and semis. Bigger homes east to Chalkwell. Large
detacheds and town houses, 800,000-1.2m. Detacheds, 450,000-800,000.
Semis, 350,000-1m. Terraces and cottages, 240,000-500,000. Flats,
140,000-375,000. Rentals: a one-bed flat, 550-750pcm; a three-bed
house, 1,000-1,600pcm.


Bargain of the week 
Two-bed art deco flat; could do with an update. 189,500, with
hairandson.co.uk.


From the streets

Katie Cohen 
"We moved from London in 2013, looking for something bigger and more
affordable. It was the best choice. I walk everywhere: beach, bars,
coffee shops or galleries. It's easy to bump into friends."

Dom Green 
"Retains its small-town feel even with the influx from London."
