Let's move to Leytonstone: the Olympics still niggles, but it's on
good form

It's quite humdrum, but mostly in a nice way

Houses in the Bushwood area of Leytonstone.

Leytonstone: "At least the gentrifiers haven't invaded in full force
yet."

What's going for it? 

The new Walthamstow. Or that might be Leyton, I forget. Or Maryland.
Or Forest Gate. There are so many contenders for Outer East End
Hotspot these days I can't keep up. Blame 2012. The Olympics
splattered money round these parts, in the form of newly minted
bollards and cheery paint schemes. It also divided opinion. Strike up
a conversation about "it" in the queue at Percy Ingle on the High Road
and six years later you're still likely to leave with a flea in your
ear as well as a sliced bloomer. Still, Leytonstone appears on good
form. The tootsie toes of Epping Forest dip into the streets to the
north, its Hollow Ponds green space fringed by office workers on their
lunch break, dreaming of escape over BLTs. A few blocks south,
conversely, escapees from the rest of the planet have come to rest on
the High Road, from Romanian delis to Turkish grills to Madame
Chic's "frizerie". There are even signs of those most benighted of
immigrants: artists. They've lived round here since the 1980s (the
1890s if you include native 'Stoner Alfred Hitchcock), famously
adding chutzpah to the M11 Link Road protests a decade later. These
days the art's less bolshie (though July's Arts Trail is a blast)
and more conceptual macrame, but at least the gentrifiers haven't
invaded in full force yet.


The case against...

Sliced by that M11 Link Road, belching pollution. Quite humdrum (but
mostly in a nice way). Still a long way from the kool kats in Hackney
and the Stow, if that's your ambition.


Well connected? 

Quick in and quick out of London - a rare commodity. Trains: the
Central line for Stratford (5 mins), Liverpool Street (14 mins) and
Oxford Circus (24 mins); Overground every 15 mins or so to Barking (10
mins), Gospel Oak (25 mins) via Walthamstow (4 mins). Driving: on the
A12 for a fast escape; 20 mins to the M25.


Schools 

Primaries: Gwyn Jones, George Tomlinson, Mayville, Jenny Hammond and
Downsell are "good", says Ofsted, with Barclay, Davies Lane and
Newport "outstanding". Secondaries: Leytonstone, Buxton, Connaught
(girls) and Norlington (boys) are "good".


Hang out at...

The fabulous Red Lion. The Birds pub. The Wild Goose Bakery does a
mean loaf.

From the streets
Ged Hanley 
"The Mini Holland initiative has helped encourage cycling. Close to
the Olympic Park for great walks down the canal to Victoria Park.
Inclusive community with a diverse population."

Julia Ingall 
"Favourite haunts: What's Cookin at the Ex-Servicemen's Club is
great for live Americana/folk music; the Pop-up Cinema in the library
for non-blockbusters. Pet hate: rubbish in the streets"

Jane Duran 
"Star of India - not just the best curry for miles around but a real
Leytonstone institution. Peeve: the daft one-way system."

Marian Head 
"Don't even consider moving to E11 until the Central line has better
trains."
