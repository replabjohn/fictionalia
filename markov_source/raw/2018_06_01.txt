Let's move to Dorking, Surrey: perfect if you're looking for the easy life

A nostalgic market-town jumble of bow-fronted antique shops and
Georgian-style bollards

Slightly more affordable than elsewhere hereabouts...



What's going for it? 

In The Communist Manifesto, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels did not
make allowances for Dorking (I've looked). Dorking is why revolution
will never come to the home counties. Dorking is what many - most? 
- people want in life, and fair enough. The easy life, for some at
least. Job that pays. Bit of a commute, mind. Nice pubs. Domino's
pizza. Fancy restaurant for fancy nights out. A nostalgic market-town
jumble of bow-fronted antique shops and Georgian-style bollards.
Gillian Gladrag's rather amazing Fluff-A-Torium on West Street,
satisfying Dorking's yarnbombers. A terribly English countryside,
conforming to all expectations; Box Hill, attracting orchid-spotters
and leathered bikers alike (occasionally in the same person; I've seen
him), is just outside. A gigantic metal cockerel. Maybe not that. But
Dorking has one, should you want it.


The case against 

Beware the shoals of Lycra-clad, middle-aged men on two wheels who
pass through most weekends: the Surrey Hills are prime cycling
territory - lovely unless you're stuck behind 46 of them on the
twisty A25. It's not cheap - they don't call this the stockbroker
belt for nothing - but slightly more affordable than elsewhere
hereabouts.


Well connected? 

Very. Trains: from Dorking station to Leatherhead (7 mins), Epsom
(13-16 mins), Horsham (22 mins), London Victoria (1 hour) and Waterloo
(51‑56 mins); from Dorking West or Deepdene stations to Guildford
(16-25 mins) and Gatwick airport (24‑28 mins). Driving: 10 or 15
mins to the M25 if the traffic's kind, 30 mins to Gatwick and
Guildford.


Schools 

Primaries: St Martin's CofE, Powell Corderoy, St Joseph's Catholic and
St John's CofE are all "good", says Ofsted, with St Paul's CofE
"outstanding". Secondaries: both the Ashcombe and the Priory CofE are
"good".


Hang out at...

Everyone's talking about new restaurant Sorrel. The Running Horses pub
in nearby Mickleham ticks the Sunday lunch box.

Jane Holmes

beautiful."

Dan Andrew 
"Not dominated by commuters: folks work locally, too."
