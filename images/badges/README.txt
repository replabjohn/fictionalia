
Most of the devices and creatures used as charges on these shields came from the 
the Free Heraldry Clipart site.

To add or remove items to be used on these shields, modify the contents of the
following directories: 
	Creatures

Ordinaries and Shields are expected to be 500 pixels high.
Creatures and Devices are expected to be 400 pixels high.

All images should be PNG files with an alpha channel. Any pixels in WHITE (rgb 255, 255, 255) 
will be replaced with the random colour being used for that charge.
